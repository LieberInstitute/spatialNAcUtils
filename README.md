`spatialNAcUtils` is intended to provide re-usable functions helpful for
various analyses in the [spatialNAc
project](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/spatial_NAc). Code is
maintained here in an R package for ease of use, and to ensure dependent
`spatialNAc` code can easily refer to the latest functions here.

For details, check the [documentation
site](http://research.libd.org/spatialNAcUtils/).

## Installation instructions

Get the latest stable `R` release from
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `spatialNAcUtils` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/spatialNAcUtils) using the
following code:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("LieberInstitute/spatialNAcUtils")
```

## Citation

Below is the citation output from using `citation('spatialNAcUtils')` in
R. Please run this yourself to check for any updates on how to cite
