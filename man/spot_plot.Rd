spot_plot(

  var_name,

  colors = NULL,
  assayname = "logcounts",

}
\arguments{
\item{spe}{A \code{SpatialExperiment} with colData column \code{exclude_overlapping},
passed to \code{spatialLIBD::vis_gene} or \code{spatialLIBD::vis_clus}}

\item{sample_id}{character(1) passed to \code{sampleid} in
\code{spatialLIBD::vis_gene} or \code{spatialLIBD::vis_clus}. Assumed to be a
donor, possibly consisting of several capture areas to plot at once}

\item{image_id}{character(1) giving the name of the image (e.g. "lowres") to
plot. Currently not displayed, but used to determine an appropriate spot size}

\item{title}{character(1) giving the title of the plot}

\item{var_name}{character(1) passed to \code{geneid} for \code{spatialLIBD::vis_gene}
or \code{clustervar} for \code{spatialLIBD::vis_clus}}

\item{include_legend}{logical(1): if FALSE, remove the plot legend}

\item{is_discrete}{logical(1): if TRUE, use \code{spatialLIBD::vis_clus};
otherwise, use \code{spatialLIBD::vis_gene}}

\item{colors}{character() of colors passed to \code{cont_colors} in
\code{spatialLIBD::vis_gene} if not \code{is_discrete}}

\item{assayname}{character(1) passed to \code{spatialLIBD::vis_gene} if
not \code{is_discrete}}

\item{minCount}{numeric(1) passed to passed to \code{spatialLIBD::vis_gene} if
not \code{is_discrete}}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object containing a "spot plot" of the specified sample
}
\description{
This function is essentially a wrapper around spatialLIBD::vis_clus and
spatialLIBD::vis_gene, suitable for merged samples (each sample in the
SpatialExperiment 'spe' is a donor consisting of multiple capture areas, with
colData column 'exclude_overlapping' indicating overlapping spots to drop (to
prevent overplotting).
}
\details{
Spot sizes are \emph{almost} consistent among donors, regardless of full-
resolution image dimensions, when title is NULL, include_legend is FALSE,
and the plot is saved to a square output (e.g. PDF with 7in width and
height). However, ggplot does not seem to scale plots of different aspect
ratios exactly consistently when writing to PDF (untested for other formats)
